# Gezio

Gezio is an application that shows you some activities around the city. It shows them based upon your favorite topics (e.g. concert, theatre etc.)

## Clone

Since this project created with expo cli, first, you must install it globally.

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Then clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yarkincaner/react-native-gezio.git
```

Finally you need to install node_modules and packages. Since all packages downloaded with --save command, just **npm install** should do the trick.

```bash
npm install
```
